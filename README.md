# Cancer Detection App

This repository contains the source code for a cancer detection application built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, edit, and delete patient records.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of patient data for analysis.
- **Cancer Prediction**: Predictive models to detect cancer based on patient data.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Django: Python web framework for building the backend.
  - Django REST Framework: Toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
  - Python: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Frontend**:
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
  - HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling.
- **Database**:
  - SQLite: Lightweight database used for development.
